            <p>
              I am a undergraduate student at the University of
              Alberta, majored in Computing Science. This is the 
              4th year in my program, and I am currently planning 
              to apply for the Graduate study.

          <p>
            As a recipient of the M&SS Undergraduate Student Research Award, I worked 
            in the research group led by Dr. Tokarsky during this summer. The research topic 
            of this group is the periodic trajectories in the polygonal surface. My work 
            was to implement relevant algorithms designed by Dr. Tokarsky, and to develop 
            various tools that help to explore the properties of periodic trajectories.  
          </p>

            Last year I was the VP Technology in the Chan Pang-Kuen Memorial Society.
            During that time I was responsible for building and maintaining the
            officaial website of our society, and thus have gained valuable
            experience in developing and deploying websites.
